Project title: The Impact of EV on the Environment
TEAM TESLA:
Ethan Martin
Candice Sessa
Scot Thompson
Chris Agwu

Project Description/Outline
We are assessing the effects electric vehicles (EVs) have on health and air quality in California. We use a datset that has the registrations of all vehicles for the year 2018, and calculate the percentage of EVs by county. We use several sources to create several unique datasets. A write up of our results is listed in the output section

We will do 5 questions

1 Chris: A scatter plot and linear regression of level of pollution (y) by percentage of EVs (x) by county. This will be run with three different pollutant variables

2 Ethan: A single t-test - breaking up the data into the top 10 counties with the highest percentage of EVs as our sample and comparing the average level of pollution of the entire state of California to see if they are statistically different. 

3 Scot: The sociodemographics of the top 10 counties with the highest % of EVs

4 Candice: We will do a linear regression looking at the number of instances of upper respitory disease as our outcome variable (y) and the level of air pollution as our explanatory variable (x)
