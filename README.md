Project title: The Impact of EV on the Environment
TEAM TESLA:
Ethan Martin
Candice Sessa
Scot Thompson
Chris Agwu

Project Description/Outline
We are looking at air pollution in two different cities, NYC and LA. LA has a higher concentration of EVs than NYC. Our hypothesis is LA will have lower air pollution and better health outcomes for their citizens.

We will do 5 questions
    1: the level of airpollution = a function of the number of electric cars in each city
    2: the level of fossil fuels consumption = a function of the number of electric cars in each city
    3: the number of electric vehicles in each city = a function of the demographics of each city (income, education, age)
    4: the number of electric vehicles in each city over time
    5: the number of respiratory claims= a function of the number of EV cars in each city

Research Questions to Answer
Motivation: climate change hurts the environment, does the increase of EV help (environment, human health, etc)

Who is looking for data sources:

EV-Chris
Income/Education/Age - Scot
Fossil Fuel Consumption-Ethan
Health-Candice
Pollution-city - Candice
